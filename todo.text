Hotels.jsx

* Create icons for "we offer"


New pages or components

* Login
* Register
* Favorites
* Profile (overlay)
* Filter (overlay)


Fix this to use react router instead of native javascript in hotel page

<a href="javascript:history.back()">&lt;&lt; Go back</a>

# an idea is to create a reusable component for it to be used on other pages as well
